"""
Run OnSite Presence Monitor in Production Mode
=============================================

Author: Tom Erik Harnes
Created: 2025-06
Version: 1.0.0

Starts the OnSite Presence Monitor using the Waitress WSGI server for
production-ready deployment.

This script should be used instead of app.py in all real deployments,
as it ensures a stable, multi-threaded server environment.

The app must be accessible on the same network for connected kiosks or
display clients to show real-time presence data via web browser.

Access:
    http://<server-ip>:8050

Note:
- Waitress is used as the WSGI server (pip install waitress)
- Configuration and ERP integration is managed by the app itself
